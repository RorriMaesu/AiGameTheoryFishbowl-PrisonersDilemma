## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Generate remaining 7 models** using optimized Rodin AI prompts
2. **Test Tit-for-Tat integration** in the live simulation
3. **Verify file copying process** for new models

### File Organization:
- âœ… Source folders: `T:\aiGameTheory\character_3dmodels\[character]/`
- âœ… Public folders: `T:\aiGameTheory\public\character_3dmodels\[character]/`
- âœ… ThreeFishbowl switch statement updated for all characters

### Quality Assurance:
- Models should be in T-pose for rigging compatibility
- FBX format preferred for animation support
- Consistent professional 3D art style across all characters
- Neutral backgrounds as specified in prompts

## ðŸ”§ Technical Integration

### ThreeFishbowl Component Status:
- âœ… Switch statement includes all 10 characters
- âœ… Proper file path mapping
- âœ… Fallback to colored spheres for missing models
- âœ… Animation support for FBX files
- âœ… Performance optimization in place

### File Naming Convention:
- Primary models: Character-specific names (e.g., `Fight Idle.fbx`, `base_basic_pbr.fbx`)
- Textures: Standard PBR naming when available
- Fallback: `character.fbx` for new models

## ðŸ“ˆ Educational Impact

### Current State:
- 3 characters have full visual representation
- Detailed strategy analysis available via tooltips
- Interactive 3D environment functional

### With Complete Model Set:
- Each strategy will have unique visual identity
- Enhanced memorability of different approaches
- Stronger connection between strategy behavior and character design
- More engaging educational experience

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Consistency

All character prompts follow consistent guidelines:
- **Style**: "Professional 3D character art style, neutral background"
- **Pose**: Full body T-pose with arms extended horizontally
- **Lighting**: Character-specific but professional (balanced, dramatic, warm, etc.)
- **Clothing**: Fitted, professional attire reflecting character personality
- **Accessories**: Strategy-specific symbolic elements

This organizational structure ensures smooth development workflow and maintains educational focus while providing engaging visual storytelling for game theory concepts.
